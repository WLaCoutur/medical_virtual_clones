## 🎯 Vision

Your medical records are worth $1,000 on the black market. This project implements a revolutionary approach to protect them while enabling life-saving medical advances.

After years investigating cybercrime, I've designed a system that combines:
- 🔒 Homomorphic encryption for computations on encrypted data
- 🎭 Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving authentication  
- ⛓️ Blockchain for immutable access logs
- 🔑 Self-destructing cryptographic keys

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Complete Privacy**: Doctors can treat you without knowing who you are
- **Bias-Free**: Standardized avatars eliminate visual discrimination
- **Patient Sovereignty**: Full control over your medical data
- **Posthumous Donation**: Contribute anonymized data to research after death

## 🛠️ Technical Components

### Implemented ✅
- [ ] Basic homomorphic encryption wrapper
- [ ] ZKP age verification demo
- [ ] Key rotation system prototype
- [ ] Simple access control smart contract

### In Progress 🚧
- [ ] Full patient data model
- [ ] Emergency access protocols
- [ ] FHIR integration
- [ ] Performance optimizations

### Planned 📋
- [ ] Multi-party computation
- [ ] Federated learning integration
- [ ] Hardware security module support
- [ ] Mobile SDK
